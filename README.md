# mini-calculator-by-matlab
mini claculator developed by Matlab is designed to implement the simple mathematics calculation. 
This calculator made by matlab is a simple tool to make simple math calculation. it works like most pocket calculator: 
press the buttons the number appear on the display, press”=” to display the result, press “clear” to delete etc.
The first time you access the calculator, the page may take a while to load, loading the calculator page should be faster after
the first time. Once the page has finished the loading, you should see the calculator, accomplished by some brief instructions.

The simple calculator supports the flowing operation:
λ	Addition (key’+’)
λ	subtraction (key’-’)
λ	multiplication (key’*’)
λ	division (key’+’)

1.  Press the “debug” button to begin.
2.  Type the first number of the equation you want to solve.
3.  Press the key for the operation you want to perform: division(/), multiplication(*), subtraction(-), or addition(+).
4.  Type the number you are adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing.
5.  Press the equals (=) sign key.
6.  Press “clear” to clear the display, if you wish to solve the another equation.


If you want to calculate several numbers all you have to do is key in the first number then hit the operator key like 
“+”, ”-”, ”*”, ”/” , key in the next number and hit the another operator key again. After you enter the final number hit 
the equal(=) key and you will have your total. Note that you receive the final result which obey arithmetic operation order,
the first calculation are multiplication or divide. The second calculation are addition and subtraction.
